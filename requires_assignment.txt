Scenario
Automate one script (or one test function) that performs all of the following steps:
1. Open homepage
Navigate to https://www.uitestingplayground.com/.
Verify:
The page title contains the text “UI Test Automation Playground”, and
At least one of the feature links (e.g., “Dynamic ID”, “Text Input”, or “Client Side Delay”) is visible.
2. Dynamic ID page
Click the “Dynamic ID” link on the home page.
On the Dynamic ID page:
Click the button with a changing/dynamic ID (the whole point is that the id changes).
Verify that the click is successful by asserting something observable:
e.g. no exception, button is still displayed, or a specific text/message is present (candidate’s choice).
Constraint: Do not locate the button by its id attribute. Use a more robust locator (text, class, etc.).
3. Text Input page
Navigate back to the home page (or directly follow the site’s “Home”/navigation if available).
Click the “Text Input” link.
On the Text Input page:
Type a custom text into the input field (for example "Selenium Test").
Click the button next to the input.
Verify that the button’s label changes to match the text you entered.
4. Client-Side Delay page
Go back to the home page again.
Click the “Client Side Delay” link.
On the Client Side Delay page:
Click the button that triggers a delayed action (the page simulates a slow client-side operation).
Use an explicit wait (WebDriverWait) to wait for a result message to appear.
Verify that:
The result message is displayed, and
The message text is not empty.
Important: Using time.sleep() only is not acceptable for this step. They should demonstrate a proper Selenium wait.
